_Inspiration_

Basketball improves overall health, benefits mental health, and keeps you fit.
If your problem is extra pounds, basketball will help you quickly lose weight and gain the long-awaited harmony.
How basketball affects human psychology? Very positive, because it forms in us many useful qualities and skills. For example, endurance is the ability to focus on a set goal, take initiative, work in a team, and take responsibility.
Playing sports makes you happier or less stressed.
With decentralized storage provider IPFS and blockchain technology, we are building a decentralized platform for you to learn how to play basketball.
We all know that sport is good for physical health. Basketball also has many psychological benefits.

_What it does_

Web Basketball Dapp introduces users to the sport of Basketball as well as contains an item store to track and ledger the delivery of basketball equipment.
Each real equipment item is ledgered via a digital one with a smart contract logic system in place to determine the demand and track items. When delivery is completed the DApp NFTs should be exchanged for the physical items.

A great win for the producers is to save on costs with improved inventory tracking and demand management.
Web Basketball DApp succeeds where off-chain software-ledger system products fail because they may go out of service, need updates, and crash with data losses. Web Basketball DApp is a very low-cost business systems management product/tool.
While competing software-based ledgering products carry monthly and or annual base fees, the only new costs accrued by the business utilizing the DApp are among new contract deployments. A new contract for a new batch of items only is needed every few months based on demand and delivery schedule.

_How we built it_

We built the application using JavaScript, NextJS, React, Tailwind CSS, and Tron. The application is hosted on Vercel. Meanwhile, the Ipfs data is stored using web3.storage.
